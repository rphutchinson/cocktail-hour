## About
Last night I was sitting out on the floating dock at my inlaws house on the creek at Litchfield
beach having a drink and feeling on top of the world. The creek there is dramatically more scenic
and the dock is dramatically more floaty at high tide. Furthermore, the sunsets at Litchfield are
legendary. I don't know what it is, must be something in the air, but sunsets at Litchfield are
the most beautiful thing in the world. So I thought about if I could figure out the times when we
would hit that magical combination of sunset and high tide occurring around the same time to make
sure not to let those moments pass us by. This project is the result of that thought.

## Tech

- a pretty basic Node.js project. I wasn't concerned about beautiful results
- uses a couple of free APIs for sunset and tide data
  - **tides:**  https://rapidapi.com/apihood/api/tides/
  - **sunsets:**  https://api.ipgeolocation.io/astronomy
- gathers data for the next 6 months with `npm run` the six month time horizon is the max of the tides api, could do longer with multiple api calls
